This type of call has got to go away. The defense should be allowed a straight line to the basket when they are moving side by side with the driver.

	 ('2024-02-01','Long_Chance3583','I was just listening to the newest Lowe Post and Chiney Ogwumike was talking about how frustrating the current rules are for defenders. She said that as a defender you cannot defend yourself from an offensive player launching in to you.

This is a sentiment I feel all the time, and as she was taking the words directly out of my soul, it suddenly hit me that people who don‚Äôt feel this way must simply not care about playing defense. I mean actually give a shit about playing defense.

This is the only logical answer to me. One, because as a coach, I know that many players don‚Äôt actually take pride in defense. And two, because I fail to see how anyone whom does take pride in defense sees the current landscape of basketball and thinks it‚Äôs okay.

Just yesterday I saw a player bowling ball backwards and take out my centers legs while screaming and 1 and putting up a horrible shot that had no chance. This isn‚Äôt just stupid, it‚Äôs dangerous. A modern defensive player is tasked with staying near the ball handler, but if the ball handler suddenly decides to bowling ball into your body, you are now called for a foul.

It is an oxymoron that should break the brain of basketball fans. But the reality is most fans only see the offensive side of the ball. While many players only care about their box score, and their highlights, which rarely show defense.

And then our best American players go overseas, on star studded rosters, and get embarrassed on a global stage as they flail for fouls and endlessly travel into turnovers.','Heat',169,'https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1aft64o/ryen_russillo_tells_the_official_nba_referee/',-0.9287,0.082,0.796,0.122),

The easiest thing for them to do would just be to not call shit where the offensive player very obviously is the one initiating contact.

Like i used to love getting tickets to see all the good teams but now ive seen Miami and Philly and i have very little interest watching Butler and Embiid bowl into people and get the call.

If Jokic or Curry or Giannis miss a big primetime matchup with an injury everybody''s disappointed but they aren''t skeptical because they don''t do that a lot. Embiid''s five year run of avoiding Denver like the plague is kind of circumstantial but at the same time he could have ended that narrative by playing any one of those games, even if was likely to end in a loss.

Let me make this clear: this is an awful look for the 76ers org way more than it is for Embiid. No one wants him to play when he''s truly hurt - which is clearly the case here.

Now amplify all that shit for a professional athlete who has to compete with other professional athletes at that level. I played in college so I''m normally one of the most skilled players in the gym. Aside from the pain I can afford to be a step slow or just shoot jumpers because I can''t drive right now. I can take plays off on D. I''m not playing against hyper athletic best in the world players where I have to go all out all the time. Also I''m not getting paid for it and they are.

I feel for Kawhi, AD, and all the other guys that deal with this shit. For Kawhi to come back and play at this level is amazing.

	 ('2024-02-01','Hesi-Timbo','Ignore my flair, this opinion is based on my love of math and sports analytics: Scoring title is MUCH different than Golden Boot or Home Run title or total touchdowns like NFL. To be clear, scoring title doesn''t mean MVP in my eyes, availability is important for measuring that.

Let''s say you miss about 10% of the season of each. Bad luck. You''ll have to score 11.1111% more per game than the next guy to equal his total output. Let''s see what that actually equates to

**Soccer**: Haaland is scoring just about a goal per game (wayyyy above average), so let''s take that as your opponent, which would be worst case for my point. Over 38 games, if you miss 4 games, you''ll need to score 4 more goals than your average, or about 0.1 more goals per game. Your goals per game gap will be miniscule compared to Haaland, if you miss out by one it''s not a huge deal. 38/34 - 38/38 = 0.12 more goals per game.

**Baseball**: The best batter this season had 1 homerun per 3 games. If you miss 16 games, you have ~4 homeruns to catch up on throughout the season. Again, it''s not anything you can chalk up to more than luck. A few slightly foul balls, a few gusts of wind away. 54/146 - 54/162 = 0.036 more homeruns per game.

**Football**: The lower volume does screw you a bit here, but again, if you miss 2 games you have 4TDs to make up over 15 games. 34/17 - 34/15 = 0.26 more TDs per game. This one I think is a sizeable difference in football, but even still, over 15 games if you can muster 4 more instances of fortune, maybe a blown coverage, you catch up.

Now finally

**Basketball**: at 36ppg (Joel before last night), if you miss 8 games, your opponent suddenly has to score 31.6 vs your 36. 4.4 more points per game, and while it''s true that it scales again to be about 11.1111% more just like for every sport, you can''t possibly make it up in a span of good luck over 2 games. In baseball, soccer, maybe football, you could make up that small per-game difference in a 2-4 game hot streak including good luck and chances. In basketball, you would need about 6 70 pieces to make up the difference while scoring at the same rate the other nights. That''s like Wilt''s career 70 pieces, but all in one season.

The luck/hot streak/situational advantage required to make up the difference in other sports is a lot less extreme, so measuring "per game" doesn''t show a lot of significance. Golden boot is more of a fun thing than a proof of who is the best scorer, whereas in basketball you simply can''t make up the difference without being *significantly* better than the person who plays more games night in and night out because outlier games are MUCH harder to come by, and those outliers would be enormous record breaking outliers. Therefore, scoring rate, with a minimum qualification, is a much better metric for the scoring award in basketball.','76ers',35,'https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1afpq4r/luka_is_only_06_ppg_behind_embiid_for_the_scoring/',0.9929,0.119,0.834,0.047),

Why would the Wizards want to play Beal, who has a lingering injury, when they''re out of the playoffs?  You know exactly what you get with Beal, so it makes sense to want to give guys like Deni, Kispert, etc. more minutes to develop.

Similarly, for LAC, Kawhi and PG both want to play.  You literally see it whenever any guy has a minutes restriction.  They get pulled off the court in a close game, and then are pissed off because they want to play.  But the organization believes (even if incorrectly) that load management helped their health in the long term, which these teams will then abide by because these guys are long term investments.
