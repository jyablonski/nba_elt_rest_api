(That's not including Giannis since he's still putting his resume together\u2014 if his career keeps going the way it has, he's probably gonna make some separation from those other four guys and maybe even start pushing Duncan for #1). \n\n...although, since we're talking about it, I guess I actually *do* have an opinion on the GOAT PF that might be controversial, which is that if we consider Duncan a power forward despite the fact that he played pretty much exclusively center from like '07 on, then there's a pretty compelling argument that Larry Bird has just as much of a claim to that title as Duncan does. When people think about Bird, they immediately go to 1986 and the Bird/McHale/Parish frontcourt trio, so I get why people think of him as a small forward exclusively, but McHale was a sixth man until halfway through the '85 season. Bird won two of his championships and about one and a half of his MVPs starting at power forward, and considering his back started breaking down around '88, I'd say he played that position for about half of his prime career.\n\n^(That being said, I do still tend to rank Bird as an SF and Duncan as a PF, mostly because it's easier.

He has 11 for the season.\n\n>Since Jordan's move from off-guard, the Bulls have gone 11-5. That, in itself, should be reward enough.\n\n>But even Jordan has been caught in triple-double-mania.\n\n>During breaks in games, Jordan has been wandering over to the scorer's table to get updates on how many rebounds, assists and points he needs to fill his three double-figure quotas.\n\n>\"The guys at the scorer's desk let me know what I need,\" he said. \"They tell me, 'You need three assists; you need two rebounds.\"'\n\n>Jordan also has been double-checking the figures with Chicago assistants.\n\n>\"They keep me in tune,\" he said. \"They keep reminding me when I come back to the huddle, how much I need.\"\n\n>Last Sunday, at home against New Jersey, the 10th assist was Jordan's final goal.\n\n>\"I knew I had nine assists,\" he said, \"and I looked at (forward) Brad (Sellers), and said, 'Brad, can I count on you for my 10th?'
